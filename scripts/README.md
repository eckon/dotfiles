# Custom scripts

The scripts can be found in the current folder.

All scripts were only tested and used privately.
There is no guarantee that they work on other systems or environments.
These can be "installed" (linked) inside a sourced folder
like `/usr/local/bin/` or `~/.local/bin/`.

## Setup scripts

Different scripts for setting up a new environment can be found in the [setup folder](./setup).

## Alternatives

I might write short programs as an alternative to these scripts:

- [quick-clone (qc)](https://github.com/eckon/quick-clone)
  as an alternative to the `gitlab-search-and-clone.sh` script
