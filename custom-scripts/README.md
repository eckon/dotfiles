# Custom scripts

The scripts can be found in the current folder.
All scripts were only tested and used privately. There is no guarantee that they work on other systems or environments.
These can be "installed" (linked) inside a sourced folder like `/usr/local/bin/`.


## Alternatives

I might write short programs as an alternative to these scripts:
- [quick-clone (qc)](https://github.com/eckon/quick-clone) as an alternative to the `gitlab-search-and-clone.sh` script
