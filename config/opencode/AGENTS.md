## Self-reflection

When giving a final response always provide a confidence score (0-100%).
If you can not do something, say so and request user input for further actions.

## Relevant Documentation

When needing/using documentation about programming languages, libraries etc., request up-to-date docs, before answering.
If a specific version is mentioned, use that version, otherwise use the latest version and its standards & best practices.
