# Code Review

Do a code review of the changes.
In general you can consider all changes that are not yet merged into master/main relevant.

Use `context7` mcp to get up-to-date information of the relevant language/framework in the review.

Focus on:

- Code quality and best practices
- Potential bugs and edge cases
- Performance implications
- Security considerations

Provide constructive feedback without making direct changes.
