# VSCode

## Setup

### Plugins
- Generally these are some of the plugins I use mostly:
  - theme
    - qufiwefefwoyn.kanagawa
  - ai
    - GitHub.copilot
      - also the other experimental features
  - vim
    - vscodevim.vim
    - _asvetliakov.vscode-neovim_
  - spelling
    - streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
      - for the general spell check in code
    - streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker-german
      - to add german spelling as well (setting is already set in config)


#### Vim plugins
- vim
  - better integration with vscode
  - better out of the box features
- neovim
  - work well enough
    - but many things need to be done via neovim plugins (commenting, surround, etc.)
    - so it is not independent of my neovim setup, which I want to prevent for now
